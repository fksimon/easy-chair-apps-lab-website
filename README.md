# Easy Chair Apps Lab — Website

Marketing and support website for Easy Chair Apps Lab apps. Hosted on GitHub Pages at [easychairappslab.com](https://easychairappslab.com).

## Structure

```
index.html              Home page (app showcase, about)
scorepad.html           ScorePad marketing page

logo.png                Lab logo

```

## Testing locally

The site is plain HTML/CSS — no build step required. Serve it with Python's built-in HTTP server so fonts and relative paths resolve correctly:

```bash
cd /path/to/easy-chair-apps-lab-website
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

To use a different port:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

> **Note:** Opening `index.html` directly as a `file://` URL works for most content, but the self-hosted fonts in `fonts/` may be blocked by the browser's CORS policy. Use the Python server to avoid this.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` deploy automatically via GitHub Pages. The custom domain is configured in `CNAME`.

## Claude Code skills

### `/update-app-pages`

Rebuilds app marketing pages from their source `MARKETING.md` files. Run from the repo root in Claude Code:

```
/update-app-pages                  # rebuild all app pages
/update-app-pages retirementplanner  # rebuild one page
/update-app-pages scorepad
```

The skill reads each app's `MARKETING.md`, compares its content to the current HTML page, and does a full rebuild of any page where the content has changed. The site's CSS, layout, animations, and icons are preserved — only the text content, feature cards, and sections are updated from the Markdown source.

The skill definition lives at `.claude/commands/update-app-pages.md`.

#### Adding a new app

Use the `/add-app` skill instead of doing this manually — see below.

### `/add-app`

Scaffolds a complete new app page and home page card from a `MARKETING.md` source file in one step:

```
/add-app "My App" ~/Workspace/MyApp/MARKETING.md
```

The skill will:

1. Create `myapp.html` — a full detail page modeled on the existing app pages, with all content derived from `MARKETING.md`
2. Add an app card to `index.html`
3. Register the new app in `.claude/commands/update-app-pages.md` so future `/update-app-pages` runs include it
4. Copy the app icon automatically — searches the source project for the Xcode `AppIcon.appiconset` (picking the largest PNG), falls back to any root-level icon file, and places it at `myapp/icon.png`

The only manual step after running is updating the App Store URL in the hero once the app is live. The skill definition lives at `.claude/commands/add-app.md`.
